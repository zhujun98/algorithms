/**
 * In this assignment we will revisit an old friend, the traveling
 * salesman problem (TSP). This week you will implement a heuristic
 * for the TSP, rather than an exact algorithm, and as a result will
 * be able to handle much larger problem sizes.
 *
 * Here is a data file describing a TSP instance:
 *
 *   TSP_nn.txt
 *
 * The first line indicates the number of cities. Each city is a point
 * in the plane, and each subsequent line indicates the x- and
 * y-coordinates of a single city. The distance between two cities is
 * defined as their Euclidean distance.
 *
 * You should implement the nearest neighbor heuristic:
 * 1. Start the tour at the first city.
 * 2. Repeatedly visit the closest city that the tour hasn't visited yet.
 * 3. Once every city has been visited exactly once, return to the first
 *    city to complete the tour.
 *
 * Correct answer: 1203406
